Hi, I’m Tara Murphy — a physicist, coder, and occasional science storyteller, currently doing a PhD in Quantum Technologies and Machine Learning at the Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge.

After studying Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin — four years buried in equations without really setting foot in a lab — I decided it was time to throw myself into the experimental world. That choice led me to a Master’s in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology at Cambridge, where I discovered a passion for working at the boundary between theory and experiment. Now, in my PhD, I sit at the intersection of the two: using machine learning and simulations to better understand and control silicon quantum devices.

Along the way, I’ve collaborated with Open Climate Fix, IBM Quantum, Quantum Motion, Tyndall National Institute and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, published tutorials with IBM Qiskit, and presented my work at international conferences. I love projects that sit at the crossroads of physics and machine learning and I'm always up for a challenge!

Beyond research, I’m passionate about outreach and teaching: mentoring students, giving tutorials, and writing blogs that make quantum science approachable. I also wrote Qubit the Cat, a quantum-themed colouring book designed to bring a playful twist to learning about quantum physics. And I’m always looking for creative ways — from writing to VR platforms — to make science more open and accessible.
